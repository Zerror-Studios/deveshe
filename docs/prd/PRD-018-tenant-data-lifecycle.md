Requirements, decisions and the contract live in the source-of-truth PRD. This file holds only **this repo's** UX and implementation notes (backend §6 "Storefronts", FR-1.6, FR-3.6, FR-4.3).

## This repo's work

| Backend FR | Change | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| FR-1.6 (D6) | **Store unavailable page** | When the API answers `TENANT_NOT_FOUND` with `extensions.reason: TENANT_SUSPENDED`, the proxy (`middleware.js`) passes the reason and `_error.jsx` / `getServerSideProps` render the page: branded, no catalog data, HTTP 503 with `Retry-After`, the store's contact email if configured. Other `TENANT_NOT_FOUND` cases keep today's behaviour. `node:test` case for the mapping |
| FR-3.6 (D3) | **Account › Privacy** | Gated phase D (lawyer), after the dashboard tool ships. "Download my data" (`requestMyDataExport`) and "Delete my account" (`requestMyAccountDeletion` with a typed confirmation), a warning about open orders (`CONFLICT` / `OPEN_ORDERS`, and the return-window warning), the 7-day cancel window with "Cancel request" (`cancelMyDataRequest`) and the request status. Signed-in shopper only; no email field (a request for another person is impossible) |
| FR-4.3 (D13) | **`/.well-known/zcom-store`** | Returns the store slug with an HMAC under `EDGE_SHARED_SECRET` (server-side only; the secret never reaches the browser). Pages Router: `src/pages/profile/` (account page) and a new `src/pages/api/well-known-zcom-store.js` rewritten from `/.well-known/zcom-store` |

## Implementation notes

- All calls go through the existing same-origin proxy and the one API client; no new dependency.
- Dialogs trap focus; the status is announced.
- Legal pages (`/privacy-policy`, `/terms-of-service`, `/shipping-returns`) must answer 200 for the go-live checklist; the backend checklist defaults to exactly these paths (fixed in the review on approval).
- Every storefront change is mirrored in the other storefront (root `CLAUDE.md` §5.5).
