Requirements, decisions and the contract live in the source-of-truth PRD. This storefront's only share is **FR-25**; nothing else in the shopper flow changes. It ships after the backend (rollout step 4) and only matters once `dunning.enabled` is switched on (gated, backend §8.1 D6).

## This storefront's share

- At checkout (`createCheckoutSession` / `completeCheckout`), `FORBIDDEN` with `extensions.reason: STORE_ORDERS_PAUSED` shows "This store isn't taking orders right now" instead of the generic error, branched on the reason (never the message). Browsing, cart and account pages are unchanged.
- A `node:test` case for the error mapping; `validate:clients` unchanged (no new operation).

## Implementation log

**2026-10-26: FR-25 DONE** (working tree, not committed). `src/utils/api-error.util.js` maps `STORE_ORDERS_PAUSED` to "This store isn't taking orders right now."; the checkout already shows errors through it, branched on `extensions.reason` (a FORBIDDEN code with this reason never falls back to the generic FORBIDDEN copy). Test: `test/order-detail.test.mjs` ("maps STORE_ORDERS_PAUSED at checkout"). No new operation; `validate:clients` unchanged by this item.
