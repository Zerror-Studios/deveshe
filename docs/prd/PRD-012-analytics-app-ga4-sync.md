This storefront's only part of PRD-012 is **order attribution** (§15 ✅ server-side purchase events, FR-7.1 Campaigns):

- `src/utils/ga-attribution.util.js` captures the visit's UTM parameters, referrer and landing page once per browser session (`sessionStorage`) in `pages/_app.jsx`, and reads the GA client id (`_ga` cookie) and session id (`_ga_*` cookie) at checkout.
- `createCheckoutSessionFromCart` sends them as `attribution: OrderAttributionInput`; the backend stores them on the order. Nothing here affects money; the server only records it.
- The GA tags themselves still come from `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` (Q12).
