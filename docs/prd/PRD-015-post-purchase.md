Requirements, decisions and the contract live in the source-of-truth PRD. This file lists only **this storefront's** share: FR-20 (and reading FR-12, FR-18, FR-19). It ships after the backend and the dashboard (rollout step 3), in the same release as the other storefront; the contract is additive, so it can trail.

## This storefront's share

- **Order detail page:** add `/profile/orders/[id]` (Pages Router; deveshe has no order detail page). Status pill from `displayStatus` (text, not colour alone); a tracking card from `shipment { courier awb trackingUrl tracking }` ("Track shipment" opens `trackingUrl`; the last scans); stop selecting the deprecated `awb_code` / `courierName` / `trackInfo`.
- **Order list:** the profile `OrderTable` gets a "View" link instead of the hard-coded `https://shiprocket.co/tracking/<awb_code>` link.
- **Cancel:** shown only when `canCancel`; a confirm dialog saying refunds go back to the original method within the store's timeline; `cancelMyOrder`; `ORDER_NOT_CANCELLABLE` → "This order can no longer be cancelled; contact the store", `PAYMENT_IN_PROGRESS` → "A payment is in progress; try again in a few minutes".
- **Returns:** "Request a return" when `returnableItems` is non-empty: per-line quantity stepper capped at `returnableQty` (with `aria-label`), reason select, condition, "return by <`returnableUntil`>" and a link to this store's own returns-policy page (approved legal copy, PRD-014 O8; the API carries no policy text); `createReturnRequest` with the line `id`s; then the order's `returnRequests` with status, and "Withdraw" on a `REQUESTED` one (`cancelMyReturnRequest`). `RETURN_WINDOW_CLOSED` → "The return window for this order closed on <date>"; other reasons mapped by `extensions.reason`, never message text.
- **Files likely touched:** `src/graphql/queries/order.gql.jsx`, `src/components/profileNew/order/`, `src/pages/profile/orders/[id].jsx`.
- **States and checks:** loading, empty, error and success; the UX-31 a11y items; `node:test` for the cancel and return form state; `validate:clients` with variable shapes; this storefront's own styling.
