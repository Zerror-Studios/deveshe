/**
 * Provider return (PRD-011 FR-4.3) — the kit's `paymentReturnHandler` (kit
 * PRD-002 FR-4.1). PayU form-posts here and Cashfree redirects here; the
 * handler keeps only the provider order id (`ref`), the provider name and
 * PayU's echoed order id (`order`, from `udf1`), checks each, caps the body
 * at 64 KB, and answers 303 to `/checkout/payment-return`, which verifies
 * with the shopper's session. Nothing in the request is trusted.
 *
 * Keep in sync with rare-element `app/api/payments/return/route.js`.
