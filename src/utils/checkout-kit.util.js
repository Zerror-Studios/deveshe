/**
 * The store's checkout form and bag → the kit's `useCheckout()` inputs
 *
 * Pure helpers the signed-in checkout (`views/CheckoutView.jsx`) and the
 * guest checkout (`components/checkout/GuestCheckout.jsx`) use around the
 * kit's `start` / `startGuest` → `pay` (kit 1.1.0):
 * - `getCartFingerprint`: the bag's lines and coupon, so a changed bag or
 *   coupon drops the confirmed total and the kit's kept unpaid order;
 * - `toCustomerCheckoutInput`: the signed-in form (email, delivery and
 *   billing address) and the bag → `start`'s input, the addresses as the
 *   backend's `OrderAddressInput` (a saved address is sent as its values,
 *   as the store always did);
 * - `isKeptOrderStale`: whether the kit's kept unpaid order (its
 *   `PendingOrderStore` entry) no longer belongs to this bag;
 * - `getDetailsKey` / `isReservedFor`: the one checkout flow of both paths
 *   ("Continue to payment" → "Pay now"): "Pay now" is enabled only while
 *   the kit's session was reserved for exactly the bag, coupon and details
 *   on screen.
 *
 * No kit or React imports, so `node:test` loads them directly.
